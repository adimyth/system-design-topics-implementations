# Point Quadtree

A quadtree is a tree data structure that is commonly used to partition a two-dimensional space into smaller regions. It is called a quadtree because each node in the tree has four children,

The quadtree starts with a root node that represents the entire space. Each level of the tree divides the space into four equal-sized quadrants. The leaf nodes of the tree represent smaller regions of the space.

***The quadtree data structure is particularly useful for spatial indexing and searching. It allows efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of objects based on their spatial location.***

It is very effecient in spatial searches such as -
1. Range search - Find all points within a given range. Ex - in computer games, to find all enemies within a certain distance from the player.
2. Nearest neighbor search - Find the closest point to a given point. Ex - in GPS navigation, to find the nearest gas station.
3. K-nearest neighbor search - Find the k closest points to a given point. Ex - in recommender systems, to find the k most similar items to a given item in a 2D representation of the items.
4. Point location - Find the region that contains a given point. Ex - in geographic information systems, to find the country that contains a given latitude and longitude.

By recursively subdividing the space, the quadtree can quickly narrow down the search area and eliminate irrelevant objects.
